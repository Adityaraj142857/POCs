					  VULNERABILITY IN FORGOT PASSWORD SYSTEM

STEP TO REPRODUCE

1.Open https://sandeepsappal.in/ and use forgot password funtionality.

2. Enter victim's Email ID and intercept the request using burpsuit (Proxy intercept).

3.You will notice that while interception you will get the link to change password. copy the link and paste in another browser.

4. Finally change the password.

This is a critical BUG which leads to account takeover and hacker can exploit it by downloading precious content only by getting email of your students. 			

I used my Friend (Naveen Mittal with his consent) account to exploit the vulbnerability.

now I will open chrome to change the password
Password change successfull .

now I will login in victim account

THANKYOU :)
HAPPY HACKING :)
